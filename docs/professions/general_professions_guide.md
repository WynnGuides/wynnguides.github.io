# A General Guide to Professions

https://forums.wynncraft.com/threads/a-comprehensive-guide-to-professions-v1-7-2.268901/

# Introduction

Professions is content meant for the player to sink in hundreds, if not, thousands of hours into playing Wynncraft. Although not comparable to to Runescape or Skyblock in terms of grinding, professions still takes a long time that the player must be willing to commit to if they desire to reach higher, useful levels. For reference, it took RadioactiveLava 18 hours to go from lv 1 to lv 110 in 1 gathering profession during dxp weekend with all of it under bombs and hunted mode during 1.19.

So, you have finally decided to dive into professions... This guide will list out every single feature, mechanic, tip, and trick known to the community to doing professions.

# General Profing

The maximum level for each skill is Lv 132. As of 2.0, the amount of XP needed to reach max level from Lv 1 to 132 for 1 profession requires 642,697,533 XP. Grind away haha...

Most people have stated that professions get really boring and grindy starting at Lv 80+. Keep this in mind if you continue towards Lv 100+. The burden eases if you use GXP (Gathering XP) gear and/or GXP guild boosts.

Most of the money from professions are made by selling T3 Dernic materials, crafting LQ and GXP gear, and to a lesser extent, selling/scraping junk crafted items gained from leveling craftings. It is rare to sell materials in bulk for Lv 80 and under to gain profit from unless for mass housing material needs. Ingredients, although indirectly related to profession grinding, can sell for a lot of money, especially in bulk or from very rare ingredients.

It is highly advisable to not do professions on your first playthrough without first completing your first playthrough combat wise. This is because the time commitment needed to level professions far exceed the time commitment needed to level combat level and lootrun for gear combined. However said, professions provide an alternative method for gaining money, abet less profit per time invested.

# Definitions

Many acronyms and dubbed words are stated in this guide.

- **Cycle:** The number of nodes in a location. Usually referred to only 1 type of node at a time. Can be used to denote how many nodes can be harvested before the first node respawns.
- **GXP:** Gathering XP. Does not work on XP earned by crafting.
- **Hunter:** Player that hunts to kill people in hunted mode that are gathering materials.
- **Ingredient:** The item that can be gathered by killing mobs or loot chests. Used as modifiers in crafting.
- **Material:** The item that can gathered from the environment. Does not come from mobs. Used as base item for crafting.
- **Node:** The block in which a material can be gathered from. Denoted by its type of material.
- **Profer:** Player that does professions.
- **Profs:** Another word for professions.
- **Prof Party:** Parties that consist of Profession XP and Profession Speed bombs. These parties can go on for hours.
- **Refine chance:** The chances of obtaining any material from a node. Usually 70-90% depending on level.
- **Ticks/Hits:** How many times it takes to swing a tool to harvest a node. Usually 4-7 times.
- **Totemed:** The mob where its spawn rates can be dramatically increased by a Mob Totem.

# Gathering

There are 4 gathering skills: Woodcutting, Mining, Farming, and Fishing. Each skill gives 2 materials, which can be chosen based on left/right clicking on the node as denoted.

## Woodcutting

**Basic definition:** Cutting down trees.
**Resources obtained:** Wood and Paper.
Woodcutting is often the favorite first starter to professions. Many players have played vanilla Minecraft, and the first thing they usually do is cut down a tree. This is no different, except the whole tree comes down after a few hits.
There are usually tens to hundreds of nodes in each place, making cycling much more efficient than other gathering skills. Dernic woodcutting is an exception however due to spacing of the nodes.

## Mining

**Basic definition:** Breaking ores.
**Resources obtained:** Ingot and Gem.
Mining is the next favorite for many players, similar to woodcutting. Minecraft is also about mining, so this is the logical next step.
There are usually 9-13 nodes in each place.

## Farming 

**Basic definition:** Harvesting crops.
**Resources obtained:** String and Grain.
When there is a need for food, farming is here!
There are usually 9-13 nodes in each place.

## Fishing

**Basic definition:** Fishing for fish.
**Resources obtained:** Oil and Meat.
When you need a relaxing time, fishing is here. Usually requires patience due to its location in water.
There are usually 9-12 nodes in each place.



To gather materials, simply left or right click on the node with the right tool. The node only needs to be clicked on once for it to auto-harvest. During harvesting, the player can open and rearrange items in inventory, look away from the node, jump from their position, and chat. The node can still be harvested even if it is obscured by players, mobs, and blocks. Hostile mobs will not attack the player during harvesting, although after ~8 seconds, they will attack again. The player can also move slightly during each hit animation, although this is often hard to reliably pull off.

To level up each skill, simply gather their respective materials. Every 10 levels unlocks a new resource to gather, up to Lv 110 for Dernic materials. Thus, the maximum useful level is Lv 110 (barring from faster gathering for Dernic materials maximum of Lv 118).

# Tools

Each skill requires their respective tools in order to harvest materials:

- Woodcutting => Axe
- Mining => Pickaxe
- Farming => Scythe
- Fishing => Fishing Rod

Each type of tool also has different tier levels as well. The player can only use higher tier tools once they reach the required gathering skill level to use the tool. The first and second tier (T1 and T2) can be bought for a few emeralds off of Tool Merchants located at various spots around the world. For T3 to T12, these can be bought off of dungeon merchants or the Trade Market. The list of where these tools can be bought are listed below:

- T1 [Lv. 1]: 4 E
- T2 [Lv. 5]: 12 E
- T3 [Lv. 15]: 1 Decrepit Sewers / Infested Pit Fragments
- T4 [Lv. 25]: 2 Lost Sanctuary / Underground Crypt Fragments
- T5 [Lv. 35]: 3 Sand Swept Tomb Fragments + 1 EB
- T6 [Lv. 45]: 4 Ice Barrows Fragments + 2 EB
- T7 [Lv. 55]: 5 Undergrowth Ruins Fragments + 4 EB
- T8 [Lv. 65]: 6 Galleons Graveyard / Corrupted Decrepit Sewers Fragments + 8 EB
- T9 [Lv. 75]: 7 Corrupted Infested Pit / Corrupted Lost Sanctuary Fragments + 16 EB
- T10 [Lv. 85]: 8 Corrupted Underground Crypt / Corrupted Sand Swept Tomb Fragments + 32 EB
- T11 [Lv. 95]: 9 Fallen Factory / Corrupted Ice Barrows / Corrupted Undergrowth Ruins Fragments + 1 LE
- T12 [Lv. 105]: 9 Eldritch Outlook Fragment / Corrupted Galleons Graveyard + 1 LE

The higher the tier of the tool, the faster the node harvests.


# Best Gathering Locations https://forums.wynncraft.com/threads/list-of-places-to-gather-materials.239484/

Please note that this list most likely isn't perfect. The CT keeps on changing these spots for better or worse and without them announcing anything, it's hard to keep all of this up to date. I'm probably missing a bunch of great spots to gather materials so I will try my best to add as many of them as I can find. Despite that, the places here should be good enough to grind at. As of now, most materials have at least one good spot with over 10 nodes. If there is a mistake with anything here like a typo or miscounting, please let me know.

### TODO:

# Crafting

There are 8 crafting skills: Armouring, Weaponsmithing, Tailoring, Woodworking, Jeweling, Cooking, Scribing, and Alchemism. Each skill requires 2 different materials, and ingredients can be added onto the base item to enhance its features.

### TODO:

Here's a graphic made by Libraeum on how each material relates to each crafting profession:

### TODO: SUB:Figure 1. Graphic on how each material relates to each crafting profession. Slightly modified by Bart (MC) to include Oil for Woodworking.

Each crafting skill requires materials of the same level. There are 4 ranges of levels you can choose from:
- 0-3
- 3-5
- 5-7
- 7-9
Add this to the level of materials you are using.

The only exception to this are Sky (Lv 100) and Dernic (Lv 110) materials. Sky materials can only be used to craft for levels 100-103, and Dernic materials can only be used to craft for levels 103-105. Thus, the maximum useful level is Lv 103.

The tier of materials can be mixed for more boosts, but the type of material must all be the same tier. For example, to craft a lv 1-3 bow, you can use 1 T1 Wood and 2 T2 String, but not 1 T1 Wood, 1 T1 String, and 1 T2 String.

The amount of materials being used for crafting can be reduced by half, rounded down, when crafted during a Profession Speed bomb. For more information on how to maximize XP gain per craft, see the second reply.

# Ingredients

There are over 500 ingredients that can be used across all crafting skills. On average, about 100 ingredients can be used for each specific crafting skill. For more information and stats of these ingredients, see Wynndata and/or Wynnbuilder and filter to ingredients and/or crafting skill.

Each crafting can use up to 6 ingredients. Ingredients are inserted by rows in descending order. If you do not want an ingredient in a certain slot, simply click it to remove it.

Ingredients offer a multiplier based on the level and tier of the ingredient. Regardless of the level and tier of the ingredient, when filling up all 6 of the ingredient slots per craft, you will gain a minimum of 10 times more XP than without using ingredients. Thus, it is always advisable to use ingredients, even if they are severely underleveled. Powders count as level 1 ingredients, regardless of tier.


# Efficient Crafting

As said earlier, ingredients offer a multiplier based on the level and tier of the ingredient. All 6 slots must be filled up in order to gain the maximum amount of XP per craft. Any ingredient works, but due to the level and tier of ingredient affecting XP multiplier, it is advisable to collect ingredients near your crafting level. Powders count as T0 level 1 ingredients, regardless of tier. However said, most ingredients can be difficult to grind efficiently, even with recommended ingredients to grind listed below. SmileAndWaveBoyz made a great guide on how much materials and ingredients you need to level up any specific crafting profession as of 1.19.

In general, his guide aims for ingredients that are extremely easy to grind, at a cost of having to use a little bit more materials to craft. His reasoning is because getting materials is much easier to get than gathering ingredients, due to both speed bombs and reliability in obtaining materials when compared to gathering ingredients. He did not use XP/Speed bombs for leveling between 1-50 for all craftings, and then used both bombs for leveling between 51-103. Note that as of 1.20, leveling low level profs are much easier than his guide due to changes in the XP curve, so the numbers listed are slightly higher than expected.

It is always advisable to use any ingredient over no ingredient for XP. For example, using Lv 1 Rotten Flesh on Dernic materials yields far more XP than that of using Dernic materials without ingredients. As such, if one were to be lazy in obtaining higher level/tier ingredients, one could buy ingredients for any craftings from the Confectionary Merchant located in Levtus Airbase to level while still possibly gaining a slight profit selling the crafteds back to the blacksmith. It is also a viable strategy to use these ingredients for leveling past Lv 100 up to 132.

# XP Decay

XP decay only occurs when you are over-leveled with respect to the level of material you are about to use.

## Gathering

XP decay occurs when you are at least 10 levels over the material level. For example, gathering Sky Wood when you are Lv 110 will activate it. The values of XP decay are currently unknown, but it is suspected to decrease XP gain by 5% of the base value for every level up to 65%.

## Crafting

XP decay occurs when you are over-leveled, but it is unclear at what level for the low level craftings. For Dernic materials, XP decay occurs starting at Lv 118 and continues to decrease further up to ~Lv 124. Just like gathering, the values of XP decay are currently unknown, but it is suspected to decrease XP gain by 10% of the base value for every level up to 50% before slowing decay down to ~65%.

# Staying Safe in Hunted Mode

Hunted mode is a toggle-able mode available after the completion of A Hunter's Calling quest (Lv 103). Completion of this quest also unlocks Hunted challenge mode for new class creation, where the player is permanently in Hunted mode. This mode allows for a x1.5 increase in all XP earned by killing mobs and gathering professions, at a cost of being able to drop 10% or more of your ID-ed items.

It is essential to get an untradeable build. This build consists of items that are untradeable and/or mythics. Horses also do not drop while in hunted mode. The gathering tool drops only if you die below 8(?) soul points. The rest is fair game.

As of now, the meta revolves heavily around Toxoplasmosis builds and those countering it. Due to the way PvP is currently built right now, Toxoplasmosis can easily shred almost all builds, and there is no easy way of countering it. The most basic counter is to actually run away. See the third reply on its debate.

If you are gathering at Lv 1-70 areas, it is almost always free of hunters. Lv 80 spots may have hunters, but they very rarely come by. Hunters usually hunt in Lv 90, 100, and especially 110 spots.

As of the 1.20 update, Hunted mode is nearly obsolete as many profers have favored GXP gear over Hunted mode due to the increased bonus and efficient GXP gained by using GXP gear over Hunted.
