## Nodes

**I. Oak** - Nivla Forest.
**II. Birch** - West side of Detlas.
**III. Willow** - Nemract Region/Dark Forest Swamp
-If you are of high-enough level, go to the Dark Forest Swamp for Willow. The forest is much more dense with trees.​
**IV. Acacia** - Savannah Region.
-The area west of Bremminglar has less Acacia then the main region but has no mobs. (Thanks, @Rixium.)​
**V. Spruce** - Nesaak/Lusuco Region.
**VI. Jungle** - The Jungle. (Including Dernal Jungle)
-There aren't many mobs around Delnar Manor. (Thanks, @Kreothaz.)​
**VII. Dark** - Dark Forest (Not Kander Forest or the Swamp)
-You could also go to Dead Island.​
**VIII. Light** - Light Forest.
**IX. Pine** - Canyon of the Lost and around Corkus.
-Unlike the other regions, these trees are much more spread out from each other. The area north of Corkus and the area just outside of Thesead are most likely the best spots just because of how dense the spots are.​
**IX.I. Bamboo** - South part in the Canyon of the Lost and east of Aldorei Town [120, -4365]
**X. Avo** - Around the Fallen Factory Dungeon and Avos Territory in general. Southwest of Corkus as well.
**XI. Sky** - Sky Islands.
**XII. Dernic** - South of Lutho around the Eyeball Forest.
