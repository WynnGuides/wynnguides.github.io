# Gathering XP/Speed Gear

Gathering XP, like the regular XP ID, increases the amount of XP obtained through gathering professions. Gathering Speed increases the speed of gathering materials. Gathering Speed does not cause nodes to regenerate faster however. These IDs are available as ingredients, Gathering Tomes, and guild boosts, and are categorized separately.

These IDs were leaked during the 1.19 update and even at one point were accidentally released for a few hours before being reverted. They are officially implemented as of the 1.20 update.

For more information about the best GXP setup for professions, see the second reply.

# GXP Tomes

There are three GXP tomes: one from Orphion's Nexus of Light (NoL, 5%), one from The Canyon Colossus (TCC, 10%), and one from The Nameless Anomaly (TNA, 15%) A total of 30% GXP can be obtained from two tomes from TNA. This GXP is multiplicative on top of other GXP bonuses.

# Territory Boosts
When a certain guild owns a territory over a profing location, that guild has the ability to boost GXP up to 100% multiplicative, for any of their guild members who happen to gather at that location.

In reality though, most guilds will not let anyone join to take advantage due to the high cost of having to maintain the boost for the guild. The only exception is [PROF], a guild started by profers to allow anyone to enjoy GXP boost only for Dernic gatherings.

# Gathering XP/Speed Gear
As of 1.20, GXP gear has been released. It is highly recommended to obtain a GXP set if you decide to grind well into Lv 100+ gatherings. Listed below are the recipes for common, high GXP gear with a maximum of 164% GXP without consumables (compiled by JKLDragon):

Gspeed Potion https://hppeng-wynn.github.io/crafter/#15050505050509j51

It is recommended to use the 24% guaranteed Armoring recipe and the cheap Walk Speed accessories over other variations due to not having to worry about low rolls in addition to having more Walk Speed to do professions faster.

It is not recommended to make Gathering Speed gear as these are only found on ingredients relating to consumables and are often a pain to get with very little benefit.

# Ingredient Grinding Builds

The higher the loot bonus, the higher ingredient drop rates there will be. The only exceptions are Royal Bug's Blood and Gollier Iron, as these ingredients drop 100% of the time at about 100% loot bonus. Here are some options compiled by @JKLDragon:

## Accessories

https://hppeng-wynn.github.io/craft...eng-wynn.github.io/crafter/#19x9c9x9x9C9c9c91
Option 1 has more Loot Bonus, but has negative walkspeed. Option 2 has less Loot Bonus, but no walkspeed penalty.

## Tailoring

You can also use Lq/Lb gear since Lq works as a 1:1 with Lb for ingredient grinding. ‚Å†

### Weaponsmithing

https://hppeng-wynn.github.io/crafter/#1AY9Q9Q9Q9Q9Q9p91
Option 1 has lb/lq. Option 2 is cheaper

### Woodworking

https://hppeng-wynn.github.io/crafter/#19Q9Q9B9Q9Q9Q9k91
Option 1 has lb/lq. Option 2 is cheaper.

Alternative gear replacements include Diamond Dust over Discoverer, Bronze Basic Ring over Old Keeper's Ring, Bronze Basic Bracelet over Knuckle Bones, Emerald Pendant over Hexed Amulet, and any Wybel weapon over Deja Vu. Of course, you can mix-and-match crafteds within the build as needed.

Loot Quality gear from Tailoring can work as a Loot Bonus set. It is found to be that one Loot Quality % equals one Loot Bonus % with regards to ingredient drop rates.
