# Efficient Ingredient Grinding

Farming the right ingredients are essential to leveling up in the most efficient way possible. What is also just as important is how to farm these ingredients.

## Buying from Merchants

The easiest and most efficient way to get ingredients is actually buying from NPC merchants. About a third of the ingredients used to level low level craftings can be bought from merchants, while mid-level craftings can be bought entirely from the Confectionary Merchant. Below is a list of recommended ingredients that can be bought from merchants:

The number in parentheses indicated the level of ingredient. All these ingredients are T0.

- Rotten Flesh (1) (3e)
- Potato (1) (2e/1 Gold Bar/4e)
- Fresh Water (5) (1 Gold Bar)
- Soft White/Red/Yellow/Green/Blue Wool (10) (1 Gold Bar)
- Bone Meal (21) (6e)
- Gold Bar (31) (16e)
- Zombie Eye (54) (12e)
- Anything from the Rymek merchant (30s) (15-25 Gold Bars)
- Anything from the Confectionary Merchant except Letvus Delight (60s) (20-28e)

For the ingredients that require Gold Bars as currency, you can buy 4 potatoes for 8e total and trade it for 1 gold bar at the merchant in Rymek, which is 50% off the regular price of 16e per.

## No totems

The majority of players do not have ranks, and as such, do not have totems. Arguably, if you don't have totems or can't get people to place totems for you, getting ingredients are significantly harder than those with totems. Below is a list of ingredients that can be grinded without totems, though using a totem will increase their drop rates.

## Using totems

Totems are best used when there are multiple mobs within an area to be totemed. The best way to significantly increase mob spawn rates are through this method listed below:

1. Find players to grind with you, if possible. More players within the range of totems will increase spawn rates significantly.
2. Gather at least 3 mobs that drop the desired ingredient to the spot to be totemed. The spot works better if the spot is in a cave or semi-walled-off area (a pit works better).
3. Place totem.
4. Wait until mobs spawn in the middle of the totem.
5. Start killing.

Only mobs that are hostile or neutral can be totemed. Below is a list of ingredients that can be grinded with totems:
